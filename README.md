Website Optimization Guide

This repository organizes practical notes, frameworks, and checklists related to improving website performance, user experience, and conversion outcomes. The goal is to document concepts in a way that helps both technical and non-technical stakeholders understand what “optimization” actually involves.

Scope of This Repository

Website optimization can mean different things depending on context. This repo focuses on three core pillars:

1. Performance Optimization

Loading speed & asset compression

Code splitting & lazy loading

CDN usage basics

Image optimization practices

Core Web Vitals considerations

2. UX / UI Optimization

Mobile responsiveness

Navigation clarity

Readability and content structure

Interactive UX guidelines

Accessibility considerations (WCAG basics)

3. Conversion Optimization

Funnel mapping & behavior insights

A/B testing fundamentals

Landing page heuristics

Form optimization practices

Micro-copy & trust indicators

Why Website Optimization Matters

Modern websites are expected to be fast, usable, and trustworthy. A poorly optimized website can increase bounce rates, reduce conversions, and negatively impact search rankings. On the other hand, incremental improvements often compound into meaningful business outcomes over time.

Included Resources

This repository contains:

Checklists for audits

Templates for planning improvements

Reference notes for UX and SEO teams

Frameworks for decision making

Benchmark metrics for evaluation

As new practices evolve, more sections will be added.
